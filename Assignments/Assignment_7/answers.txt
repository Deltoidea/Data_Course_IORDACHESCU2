# 1.  Which religious group correlates most strongly in a given area with the proportion of non-religious people?
#     Looks like the episcopal church has the highest correlation to greater numbers in areas where total religiosity is low. 
# 2.  What is the direction of that correlation?
#     It is a positive correlation because the proportion on the x axis is the proportion of religious people not non religious.
# 3.  What can you say about the relationships shown here?
#     Many of them look pretty weak. There are some definite trends going on, but with a lot of the groups, the trends are based very little data.
# 4.  Examine the axis scales. How could you modify the code above to more accurately portray values on an "equal footing?"
#     Fixing the axis scales would work, although you would need to remove the Pop.Group from the data as it scrunches all the other data up a ton.
