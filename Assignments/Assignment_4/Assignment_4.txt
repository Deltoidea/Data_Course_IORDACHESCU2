1. The read.csv() function automatically reads character vectors as factors. On the other side of things it reads numeric vectors as such instead of factors or character vectors.

2. The main difference is the separating character. For read.csv() the separating character is ",". In read.csv2() the separating character is ";".

3. csv2() exists because in Europe and other locations, semicolons are used instead of commas when writing out tables of data. 

4. Reading State as a character vector instead of a factor can be accomplished through the option of stringsAsFactors = FALSE within the read.csv() function.

5. summary(df$Home.Value) would give the summary stats for only the Home.Value column.

6. names(df)[4] outputs the name of the 4th colunm: Home.Value.

7. When col=df$region, the points are color coded by the values in the region colunm.
